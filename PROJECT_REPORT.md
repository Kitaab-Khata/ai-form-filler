        "launch_date": {"type": "date", "label": "Launch Date"},
        "program_duration": {"type": "slider", "label": "Program Duration (months)", "min": 1, "max": 24},
        # ... 7 more fields
    },
    "page_2": {
        "product_type": {"type": "radio", "label": "Product Type", "options": ["Standard", "Gold", "Platinum", "Business"]},
        "interest_rate": {"type": "slider", "label": "Interest Rate (%)", "min": 0.0, "max": 30.0, "step": 0.1},
        # ... 8 more fields
    },
    "page_3": {
        "credit_score_requirement": {"type": "select", "label": "Credit Score Requirement", "options": [...]},
        "employment_status": {"type": "multiselect", "label": "Employment Status", "options": [...]},
        # ... 8 more fields
    }
}
```

### AI Integration Workflow
1. **User Input**: Natural language description of program requirements
2. **Schema Mapping**: System provides field schema to AI for context
3. **GPT-4 Processing**: AI extracts relevant field values and identifies unsupported fields
4. **Data Population**: Supported fields are populated across all pages
5. **Validation**: Data types and formats are validated against field requirements
6. **Feedback**: Users receive success confirmation and unsupported field warnings

### Navigation State Management
```python
def init_session_state():
    if 'current_page' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.current_page = 0
    if 'form_data' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.form_data = {}
    if 'unsupported_fields' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.unsupported_fields = []
```
