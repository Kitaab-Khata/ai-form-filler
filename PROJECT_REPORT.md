- **Success Feedback**: JSON display of submitted form data

## üîß Implementation Details

### Form Schema Definition
```python
form_schemas = {
    "Customer Info": {
        "name": "string",
        "age": "number", 
        "country": "string (select from common countries)",
        "is_active": "boolean"
    },
    "Product Feedback": {
        "product_name": "string",
        "rating": "number (1-5)",
        "comments": "string"
    },
    "Support Request": {
        "issue": "string",
        "severity": "string (Low, Medium, High, Critical)",
        "preferred_contact_time": "string"
    }
}
```

### AI Integration Flow
1. User inputs natural language description
2. System sends structured prompt to GPT-4
3. GPT-4 processes and returns JSON mapping
4. Application parses JSON and populates form fields
5. User reviews and submits completed form

## üìä Testing Examples

### Sample Prompts and Expected Outputs

**Customer Info Example:**
- **Input**: "A 30-year-old customer from India who is active and interested in premium support"
- **Output**: `{"name": "Customer", "age": 30, "country": "India", "is_active": true}`

**Product Feedback Example:**
- **Input**: "Customer loves the new smartphone app, rates it 5 stars, says it's intuitive and fast"
- **Output**: `{"product_name": "smartphone app", "rating": 5, "comments": "intuitive and fast"}`

**Support Request Example:**
- **Input**: "Critical login issue, user can't access account, prefers to be contacted in the evening"
- **Output**: `{"issue": "login issue, can't access account", "severity": "Critical", "preferred_contact_time": "evening"}`
